A collaboration between Greer Muldowney and Gabriel Sosa, integrates photographs of a quickly gentrifying Somerville, MA with text from the 1984 Reagan campaign ad of the same name. The pictured community (left ambiguous as a stand in for many under socio-economic strain) and the reference to the decades-old ad is a gesture that reminds us of the rhetorical tropes in U.S. politics as well as the fallible persistence of the American Dream.


This video installation was shown at the 2019 Illuminus Festival in downtown Boston. All install images by Aram Boghosian.
