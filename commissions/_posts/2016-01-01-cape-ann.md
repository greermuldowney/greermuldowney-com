As an outsider to Cape Ann and New England in general, there were certain clich√©s that I assumed about the visuals and socio-economic makeup of the area. Hydrangeas, lighthouses, lobster traps, etc.  Upon arrival I was informed by seasoned locals and business owners alike that these visual tropes are well entwined with the tourist and architectural history of the Island, and are celebrated and used to stimulate more growth for a future that still relies on the icons of it's past. 

This push-and-pull to keep the past and maneuver the future are represented in this small selection of photographs I made on Cape Ann; to highlight the unique sensibility of the place and the conjured visuals of the New England Coastline.
