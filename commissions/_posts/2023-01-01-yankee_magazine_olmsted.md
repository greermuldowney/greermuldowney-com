To celebrate the bicentennial of Frederick Law Olmsted's legacy, I was tasked with photographing all of his firm's designs across the Boston area. Following the trail set forth by writer Miles Howard, I had the unique task of photographing the Emerald Necklace, Arnold Arboretum, Boston Common, Olmsted Park, the Charles River Esplanade and so many more amazing locations built for the enjoyment of the public. 

These photographs were originally published in the Spring 2023 issue of Yankee Magazine.
