To travel abroad encompasses the thrill of new sites, sounds and tourists attractions. The unfamiliarity of culture and landscape that so many photographs try to capture. This work represents the other side of living abroad. The constant travel on the bus; the unfamiliar and uncomfortable living situation. These photographs represent the more banal moments of my time in Hong Kong that may not make it to the travel album or into the stories home.

These images were all made while utilizing the public transportation system of Hong Kong, SAR.
