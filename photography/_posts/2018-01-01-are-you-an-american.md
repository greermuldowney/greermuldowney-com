_A Collaboration with Caleb Cole_

This found book, originally a collection of "classic" American texts published during a previous moment of crisis (World War II), served as the canvas we have altered to respond to the current political climate. Most notably, we redacted and reacted to texts by Thomas Paine, Theodore Roosevelt, the Declaration, and the Constitution with current media images, politically-charged headlines and vintage ephemera to interrogate the original intentions of the texts, how their meanings have evolved over time, and how they might be manipulated to support the rise of a modern day tyranny.

This gallery shows selected spreads from the limited edition book. Hard copies available from the artists.
